# Introduction to Software Design

This class was comprised of 8 homework assignments and one group project that we had a weekend to work on.

The GitLab repository we had to use included all the textbook examples and had the occasional inclass quiz.
The homework assignments were divided into two different modules `oral_exam1` and `oral_exam2` which had 3 and 5 assignments respecitvely.

Each assignment, including the project, had javadocs created for it
