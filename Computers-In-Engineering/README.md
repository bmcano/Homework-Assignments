# Computers In Engineering

### Gary Christensen

Homework assignments from my ENGR:2730 (Computers in Engineering) course.

There will be a README in each homework asssignment directory explaining the general idea of the assignment. Some of them were just adding comments to other code explaining what was going on, and most was programming our own projects.
