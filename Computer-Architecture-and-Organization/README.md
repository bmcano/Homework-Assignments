# Computer Architecture and Organization

### Professor: Yu-Jung Chu

This class had a 2 part project, most files were given to us, and we had to modify certain sections of different files like `sisc.v` and `ctrl.v` in both parts.

Both parts also included a checkoff with a TA that had followup questions relating to the project.
