# Computer Architecture and Organization

### Professor: Yu-Jung Chu

#### Course Description (MyUI):
Basic concepts; computer evolution, register transfer level design, simulation techniques, instruction sets (CISC and RISC), assembly language programming, ALU design, arithmetic algorithms and realization of arithmetic functions, hardwired and microprogrammed control, memory hierarchies, virtual memory, cache memory, interrupts and DMA, input/output; introduction to high performance techniques, pipelining, multiprocessing; introduction to hardware description languages (Verilog, VHDL); students design and simulate a simple processor.

#### Assignment Notes:
This class had a 2 part project, most files were given to us, and we had to modify certain sections of different files like `sisc.v` and `ctrl.v` in both parts.

Both parts also included a checkoff with a TA that had followup questions relating to the project.
