# Computer-Science-1

All of these assignments were completed in the class `CS:1210`.

Note, some of the question of the days (QotD) and lab assignments are not correct solutions.

The question of the day assignments were a quick exercise that was assigned after most lectures that we had a day to complete, mostly just testing a simply concept while needing to pass test cases that were given and unknown ones as well.

The labs were a weekly assignment that we were pair into groups of 2 or 3 that usually build off each other.

The homeworks were assignments that they gave us a few weeks to complete and they were independent assignments.
